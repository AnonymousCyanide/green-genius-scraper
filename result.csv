A Fungus - killing water produced in a machine that combines water, electctricity and minerals.It enhances the water properties to create a nuetral anolyte soltion of powerful Di-Atomic Oxygen.This product is produced using very advanced scientific technology that enables the oxygen molecule to remain stable in water for an extended period of time thus allowing a plant to have a readily available supply of oxygen when it is required. Uptake is to such a degree that results are outstanding. For roots, simply add 1ML per 1L of water to return watering system, repeat every 3 days, hand watering 1 - 10ml per 1L and repeat every 3 days.As a foliar, add 20MLS per 1L of water (preferably filtered water) and spray vigorously over affected area once per week until problem subsides. Maybe used weekly as a preventative. CautionAlthough 016 has not shown any detrimental effects to plant growth even with much higher dosages than what have been recommended, however in much the same way as using any new product, please trial on a small section first until the desired result has been achieved.016 is not and has no resemblance to Hydrogen Peroxide (H202), 016 has no adverse affects when in contact with the skin. 016 is pH neutral and its effects are long and lasting unlike that of H202."
